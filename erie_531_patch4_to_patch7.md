# Patch Execution

## Update Cluster-Scoped Resources for Scheduling Service

**IBM Documentation:** [Updating cluster-scoped resources for the scheduling service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-updating-cluster-scoped-resources-scheduling-service)

**Note:** If the scheduling service is not installed in your environment, skip this section and proceed to applying the patch to the scheduling service section.

#### 1. Verify Scheduling Service Installation

Check if the scheduling service is installed:

```bash
oc get scheduling -A
```

**If no resources are found:** Skip this section and the next section (Apply Patch to Scheduling Service), then proceed to updating cluster-scoped resources for IBM Software Hub.

**If scheduling resources are found:** Continue with the steps below.

#### 2. Generate Cluster-Scoped Resources for Scheduling Service

Generate the `cluster_scoped_resources.yaml` file for the scheduling service
```bash
cpd-cli manage case-download \
--components=scheduler \
--release=5.3.1 \
--patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
--scheduler_ns=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE} \
--case_download=false \
--cluster_resources=true
```

Copy and apply the cluster-scoped resources command returned in the terminal
```bash
oc apply -f <cpd-cli-workspace/...work>/cluster_scoped_resources.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts
```

**Optional:** Rename the file to keep a record
```bash
mv cluster_scoped_resources.yaml 5.3.1-PATCH-${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE}-cluster_scoped_resources.yaml
```


## Apply Patch to Scheduling Service

**IBM Documentation:** [Applying a patch to the scheduling service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-applying-patch-scheduling-service)

**Note:** If the scheduling service is not installed, this section was skipped in the previous step.

#### 1. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure environment variables are set from previous steps
```bash
echo $PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE
echo $PATCH_ID
echo $IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX
echo $IMAGE_PULL_SECRET
```

#### 2. Apply Patch to Scheduling Service

Applying specific patch
```bash
cpd-cli manage apply-patch \
--release=5.3.1 \
--patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
--scheduler_ns=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE} \
--image_pull_prefix=${IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX} \
--image_pull_secret=${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET}
```

#### 3. Monitor Scheduling Service Pods
```bash
oc get pods --namespace=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE}
```

## Update Cluster-Scoped Resources for IBM Software Hub

**IBM Documentation:** [Updating cluster-scoped resources for the instance](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-updating-cluster-scoped-resources-instance)

#### 1. Generate Cluster-Scoped Resources

Generate the `cluster_scoped_resources.yaml` file for the instance
```bash
cpd-cli manage case-download \
--components=${COMPONENTS_TO_PATCH} \
--release=5.3.1 \
--patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
--operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--case_download=false \
--cluster_resources=true
```

Copy and apply the cluster-scoped resources command returned in the terminal
```bash
oc apply -f <cpd-cli-workspace/...work>/cluster_scoped_resources.yaml --server-side --force-conflicts
```

**Optional:** Rename the file to keep a record
```bash
mv cluster_scoped_resources.yaml 5.3.1-PATCH-${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}-cluster_scoped_resources.yaml
```

## Apply Patch to Services and Components

**IBM Documentation:** [Applying a patch](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-applying-patch)

**Note:** This step patches the IBM Software Hub platform and all installed services/components (cpd_platform, zen, watson_discovery, etc.). Service instance updates are performed separately in a later step.

#### 1. Verify Prerequisites

Before applying the patch, verify environment variables and component status

Verify environment variables
```bash
echo $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS
echo $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS
echo $PATCH_ID
echo $IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX
echo $IMAGE_PULL_SECRET
```

Check all components are ready
```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

#### 2. Apply Patch to Services and Components

**Note:** This command applies patches to ALL installed services and components and runs for an extended period (typically 30-90 minutes). Using `nohup` ensures the command continues if the terminal session disconnects.

Applying specific patch
```bash
nohup cpd-cli manage apply-patch \
--release=5.3.1 \
--patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
--operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
--instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
--image_pull_prefix=${IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX} \
--image_pull_secret=${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET} > patch_output.log 2>&1 &
```

#### 3. Monitor Patching Progress

Monitor the output log
```bash
tail -f -n 100 patch_output.log
```

Check for completion message: `[SUCCESS] ... The apply-patch command ran successfully.`

Monitor the overall patching progress
```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

**Note:** You can also monitor specific CR progress as well

Check datastage CR status
```bash
oc get datastage
```

Example output
```bash
NAME        VERSION   RECONCILED   STATUS      PERCENT   AGE
datastage   5.3.3     5.3.3        Completed   100%      2d19h
```

Check pipelines CR status
```bash
oc get wspipelines
```

Example output
```bash
NAME        VERSION   RECONCILED   STATUS      PERCENT   AGE
wspipelines   5.3.3     5.3.3        Completed   100%      2d19h
```

#### 4. Confirm Operands Status

Confirm that the status of all operands is `Completed`
```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Check for any pods not in Running state
```bash
oc get po -A -owide | egrep -v '([0-9])/\1' | egrep -v 'Completed'
```

# Post-Patch Tasks

## Verify Patch Application

#### 1. Verify IBM Software Hub and Component Versions

Confirm the platform and all components are running the patched version
```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

#### 2. Verify Pod Health

Check for pods not in Running state
```bash
oc get po -A -owide | egrep -v '([0-9])/\1' | egrep -v 'Completed'
```

#### 3. Verify Service Instance Status

Check that all service instances are ready
```bash
cpd-cli service-instance list --profile=${CPD_PROFILE_NAME}
```
