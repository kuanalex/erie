# Patch Execution

## Update Cluster-Scoped Resources for Scheduling Service

**IBM Documentation:** [Updating cluster-scoped resources for the scheduling service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-updating-cluster-scoped-resources-scheduling-service)

**Note:** If the scheduling service is not installed in your environment, skip this section and proceed to applying the patch to the scheduling service section.

#### 1. Verify Scheduling Service Installation

Check if the scheduling service is installed:

```bash
oc get scheduling -A
```

**If no resources are found:** Skip this section and the next section (Apply Patch to Scheduling Service), then proceed to updating cluster-scoped resources for IBM Software Hub.

**If scheduling resources are found:** Continue with the steps below.

#### 2. Generate Cluster-Scoped Resources for Scheduling Service

Generate the `cluster_scoped_resources.yaml` file for the scheduling service:

```bash
cpd-cli manage case-download \
  --components=scheduler \
  --release=5.3.1 \
  --patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
  --scheduler_ns=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE} \
  --case_download=false \
  --cluster_resources=true
```

Change to the work directory:

```bash
cd cpd-cli-workspace/olm-utils-workspace/work
```

Log in to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as a cluster administrator:

```bash
${OC_LOGIN}
```

**Remember:** `OC_LOGIN` is an alias for the `oc login` command.

Apply the cluster-scoped resources:

```bash
oc apply -f cluster_scoped_resources.yaml \
  --server-side \
  --force-conflicts
```

**Optional:** Rename the file to keep a record:

```bash
mv cluster_scoped_resources.yaml 5.3.1-PATCH-${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE}-cluster_scoped_resources.yaml
```


## Apply Patch to Scheduling Service

**IBM Documentation:** [Applying a patch to the scheduling service](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-applying-patch-scheduling-service)

**Note:** If the scheduling service is not installed, this section was skipped in the previous step.

#### 1. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure environment variables are set from previous steps:

```bash
echo $PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE
echo $PATCH_ID
echo $IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX
echo $IMAGE_PULL_SECRET
```

#### 2. Apply Patch to Scheduling Service

**Applying specific patch:**

```bash
cpd-cli manage apply-patch \
  --release=5.3.1 \
  --patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
  --scheduler_ns=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE} \
  --image_pull_prefix=${IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX} \
  --image_pull_secret=${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET}
```

#### 3. Monitor Scheduling Service Pods

```bash
oc get pods --namespace=${PROJECT_SCHEDULING_SERVICE}
```

## Update Cluster-Scoped Resources for IBM Software Hub

**IBM Documentation:** [Updating cluster-scoped resources for the instance](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-updating-cluster-scoped-resources-instance)

#### 1. Generate Cluster-Scoped Resources

Generate the `cluster_scoped_resources.yaml` file for the instance:

```bash
cpd-cli manage case-download \
  --components=${COMPONENTS_TO_PATCH} \
  --release=5.3.1 \
  --patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
  --operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
  --case_download=false \
  --cluster_resources=true
```

Change to the work directory:

```bash
cd cpd-cli-workspace/olm-utils-workspace/work
```

#### 2. Apply Cluster-Scoped Resources

Apply the cluster-scoped resources:

```bash
oc apply -f cluster_scoped_resources.yaml \
  --server-side \
  --force-conflicts
```

**Optional:** Rename the file to keep a record:

```bash
mv cluster_scoped_resources.yaml 5.3.1-PATCH-${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS}-cluster_scoped_resources.yaml
```

## Apply Patch to Services and Components

**IBM Documentation:** [Applying a patch](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-applying-patch)

**Note:** This step patches the IBM Software Hub platform and all installed services/components (cpd_platform, zen, watson_discovery, etc.). Service instance updates are performed separately in a later step.

#### 1. Verify Prerequisites

Before applying the patch, verify environment variables and component status:

```bash
# Verify environment variables
echo $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS
echo $PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS
echo $PATCH_ID
echo $IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX
echo $IMAGE_PULL_SECRET

# Check all components are ready
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

#### 2. Apply Patch to Services and Components

**Note:** This command applies patches to ALL installed services and components and runs for an extended period (typically 30-90 minutes). Using `nohup` ensures the command continues if the terminal session disconnects.

**Applying specific patch:**

```bash
nohup cpd-cli manage apply-patch \
  --release=5.3.1 \
  --patch_id=${PATCH_ID} \
  --operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} \
  --instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} \
  --image_pull_prefix=${IMAGE_PULL_PREFIX} \
  --image_pull_secret=${IMAGE_PULL_SECRET} > patch_output.log 2>&1 &
```

#### 3. Monitor Patching Progress

Monitor the output log:

```bash
tail -f -n 100 patch_output.log
```

Check for completion message: `[SUCCESS] ... The apply-patch command ran successfully.`

Monitor the overall patching progress:

```bash
# Watch component status
watch -n 60 'cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}'
```

#### 4. Confirm Operands Status

Confirm that the status of all operands is `Completed`:

```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status \
  --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

Check for any pods not in Running state:

```bash
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} | grep -v Running | grep -v Completed
```

# Post-Patch Tasks

## Verify CPD Profile

#### 1. Verify Existing Profile

Confirm your CPD profile is set up and working:

```bash
cpd-cli service-instance list --profile=cpd-admin
```

#### 2. Verify Patched Instance Status

Check the status of the patched instance:

```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status \
  --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

## Update Service Instances

**IBM Documentation:** [Updating service instances](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=patches-updating-service-instances)

**Note:** Some services (Planning Analytics, Watson Discovery, Watson OpenScale, Watson Speech, watsonx Assistant, watsonx Orchestrate) are automatically updated during patching and require no manual action.

### Common Monitoring and Verification Procedures

After updating any service instance, use these commands to monitor and verify:

**Monitor instance status:**
```bash
watch -n 30 'cpd-cli service-instance status \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --service-type=<service-type> \
  --all-namespaces'
```

**Verify completion:**
```bash
# List all instances
cpd-cli service-instance list \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --service-type=<service-type> \
  --all-namespaces

# Check specific instance details
cpd-cli service-instance status \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --service-type=<service-type> \
  --instance-name=<instance-name> \
  --namespace=<instance-namespace>
```

---

### Service Instance Updates

#### DataStage Enterprise Plus

DataStage Enterprise Plus service instances

Update all instances:
```bash
cpd-cli service-instance update \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --service-type=datastage_ent_plus \
  --all
```

*Use [Common Monitoring and Verification Procedures](#common-monitoring-and-verification-procedures) above with `service-type=datastage_ent_plus`*

---
#### Watson Studio Pipelines

Watson Studio Pipelines service instances

Update all instances:
```bash
cpd-cli service-instance update \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --service-type=ws_pipelines \
  --all
```

*Use [Common Monitoring and Verification Procedures](#common-monitoring-and-verification-procedures) above with `service-type=ws_pipelines`*

## Verify Patch Application

#### 1. Verify IBM Software Hub and Component Versions

Confirm the platform and all components are running the patched version:

```bash
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status \
  --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

#### 2. Verify Pod Health

Check that all pods are running and healthy:

```bash
# Check for pods not in Running state
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} | grep -v Running | grep -v Completed

# Check for pods with high restart counts
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} --sort-by=.status.containerStatuses[0].restartCount | tail -20

# Check for pods in error states
oc get pods -n ${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS} --field-selector=status.phase!=Running,status.phase!=Succeeded
```

#### 3. Verify Service Instance Status

Check that all service instances are ready:

```bash
# List all service instances
cpd-cli service-instance list \
  --profile=cpd-admin \
  --all-namespaces
