## Pre-requisites

### 1. Backup of the cluster is done

Backup your Cloud Pak for Data cluster before the upgrade.

**Note:**
Make sure there are no scheduled backups conflicting with the scheduled upgrade.

### 2. The image mirroring completed successfully

Ensure you have access to the IBM® Entitled Registry for pulling images during the upgrade.

### 3. The CASE files and cluster resource files downloaded successfully

Before upgrading IBM Scheduling, the IBM Software Hub platform, or any services, you must download the required cluster‑scoped resources—such as ClusterRoles and ClusterRoleBindings—for the components you plan to upgrade. Ensure that these files are available on the bastion node for use during the upgrade.

For more information, see [Downloading CASE packages](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.4.x?topic=pruirn-downloading-case-packages-1).


### 4. The permissions required for the upgrade is ready

- **OpenShift cluster permissions**
  
  An OpenShift cluster administrator can complete all of the installation tasks.
  
  However, if you want to enable users with fewer permissions to complete some of the installation tasks, refer to the IBM Documentation about `Reauthorizing an instance administrator with the minimum RBAC to upgrade components`.

- **IBM Software Hub permissions**
  
  The Cloud Pak for Data administrator role or permissions is required for upgrading the service instances.

- **Registry permissions**
  - Access to the IBM Entitled Registry for pulling images

- **Bastion node access**
  - Access to the bastion node for executing the upgrade commands

### 5. A pre-upgrade health check is made to ensure the cluster's readiness for upgrade

- The OpenShift cluster, persistent storage, IBM Software Hub platform and services are in healthy status.

### 6. Migrating to Red Hat OpenShift certificate manager

The IBM Certificate manager is deprecated.

If the IBM Certificate manager (ibm-cert-manager) is installed on your cluster, refer to IBM Documentation to migrate your certificates from the IBM Certificate manager to the Red Hat OpenShift certificate manager (cert-manager Operator).

[Migrating from the IBM Certificate manager to the Red Hat OpenShift certificate manager](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.4.x?topic=upgrading-migrating-red-hat-openshift-certificate-manager)



# Pre-upgrade

**Note:**
Sourcing the latest environment variables used by this environment before proceeding with the following procedures. For more information, see [Updating your environment variables script](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=cri-updating-your-environment-variables-script-1).

```bash
source ./cpd_vars.sh
```

## Pre-upgrade check

### Checking the health of your cluster

```bash
${OC_LOGIN}
oc get nodes,co,mcp

${CPDM_OC_LOGIN}
cpd-cli manage get-cr-status --cpd_instance_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
cpd-cli health cluster
cpd-cli health nodes
cpd-cli health operators --operator_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERATORS} --control_plane_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
cpd-cli health operands --control_plane_ns=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```

### Checking the known issues before the upgrade

- [Known issues and limitations for IBM Software Hub](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=overview-known-issues-limitations)

## Updating the IBM Software Hub command-line interface

### Updating the IBM Software Hub command-line interface

Update the cpd-cli utility to the latest version of 5.3.x (v14.3.1.7). For detailed documentation and instructions, see [Update the cpd-cli utility](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=workstations-updating-software-hub-cli).

### Obtaining the olm-utils-v4 image

All IBM Software Hub customers are entitled to use the olm-utils-v4 image. The cpd-cli uses podman to pull and manage the olm-utils-v4 container image. When the workstation is connected to the internet, run the following command to update the olm-utils-v4 image on the workstation:

```bash
cpd-cli manage restart-container
```

Wait for the cpd-cli to return the following messages:

```
[SUCCESS] ... Successfully pulled the container image icr.io/cpopen/cpd/olm-utils-v4:${VERSION}
[SUCCESS] ... Successfully started the container olm-utils-play-v4
[SUCCESS] ... Container olm-utils-play-v4 has been re-created
```

The version of the olm-utils-v4 image should be the same as the version of IBM Software Hub that you plan to install.

For more information, see [Obtaining the olm-utils-v4 image](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.3.x?topic=pruirn-obtaining-olm-utils-v4-image-1).

# Post-upgrade


## Setting up a profile to upgrade service instances
Create a profile on the workstation from which you will upgrade the service instances.

<br>
**Note:**
The profile must be associated with a IBM Software Hub user who has either the following permissions:
<br>
- Create service instances (can_provision)
- Manage service instances (manage_service_instances)

<br>

1.Generate the API key that you need for user authentication by going to your `Profile and settings` page in the web client and clicking `Generate API key`.

<br>

2. Set the following environment variables.
<br>

- Set the API_KEY to the API key that you obtained in the preceding step.
```
export API_KEY=<api-key>
```

- Set the CPD_USERNAME environment variable to your username.
```
export CPD_USERNAME=<user-name>
```

- Set the LOCAL_USER environment variable to the name that you want to use for the local user configuration.

```
export LOCAL_USER=<local-user>
```

- Set the CPD_PROFILE_NAME environment variable to the name that you want to use for the profile.
```
export CPD_PROFILE_NAME=<cpd-profile-name>
```

- Set the CPD_PROFILE_URL environment variable to the URL of the instance that you want to connect to.
```
export CPD_PROFILE_URL=<cpd-url>
```

To get the URL of the web client, run the following command.
```
oc get route cpd \
        --namespace=${PROJECT_CPD_INST_OPERANDS}
```
 The command returns output with the following format.
```
cpd-namespace.apps.OCP-default-domain
```

Add https:// to the value that is returned. For example, `https://cpd-namespace.apps.OCP-default-domain`.

- Create a local user configuration to store your username and API key by using the config users set command.
```
cpd-cli config users set ${LOCAL_USER} \
    --username ${CPD_USERNAME} \
    --apikey ${API_KEY}
```

Anytime you regenerate your API key, you must rerun this command to update your local user configuration.

<br>

- Create a profile to store the URL and to associate the profile with your local user configuration by using the config profiles set command.
```
cpd-cli config profiles set ${CPD_PROFILE_NAME} \
    --user ${LOCAL_USER} \
    --url ${CPD_PROFILE_URL}
```
For example:
```
    users:
    - name: 682-d-engineer_1
      user:
        username: cpadmin
        apikey: {base64: c1BPZnhRZ1pyTEVyeWdkdUpEdGtqT3lpMTdpcm9HWm5JSDcza3VDcQ==}

    - name: my_profile
      profile:
        type: private
        url: https://cpd-cpd-instance.apps.ivt564.cp.example.ibm.com
        user: 682-d-engineer_1
    ....
```

- Validate your configuration by using below command.

You can now run cpd-cli commands with this profile as shown in the following example.
```
cpd-cli service-instance list \
--profile=${CPD_PROFILE_NAME}
```
